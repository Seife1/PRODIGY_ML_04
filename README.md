# CNN Hand Gesture Recognition Project

This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model was built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging a dataset of images representing different hand gestures. The goal was to classify the images into various gesture categories with high accuracy. After training, the model achieved a validation accuracy of 77%.

## Key Features
* **CNN Model for Gesture Recognition:** A deep learning model that classifies hand gestures into multiple categories.
* **Data Augmentation:** Various augmentation techniques such as random flipping, rotation, and zooming were applied to the dataset to improve model generalization.
* **Model Evaluation:** The performance was monitored using training and validation loss and accuracy to ensure the model's effectiveness.
